# Operating System
My attempt at making a very basic operating system. Eventually, I have hopes of naming this project other than "Operating System", but I always find myself with a lack of creativity when it comes to naming. 

## Project Goals
As I've been learning assembly and finding interest in C, I've decided it would be a nice challenge for me to create a *very* basic operating system. The current goal is to boot, call some C methods, and create an echo command which will print out any string supplied on a new line. I will document significant progress in this README below.
