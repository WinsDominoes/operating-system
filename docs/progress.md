## Progress
### May 10th, 2021
Successfully created a bootloader and called a very basic kernel which simply outputs text using a print()
function I created. Major credit to [FRosner/FrOS](https://github.com/FRosner/FrOS/tree/minimal-c-kernel) and his Dev
article for booting and calling the kernel.
